# FriendPosition
The FriendPosition app is a simple app with which you can trace the positions of your friends. The app uses a simple protocol (POSITION_REQUESTS and POSITION_RESPONSES), using SMS as the transport mechanism when sending position requests and position responses.

A key feature of the app is that it hasn't have to be started when it processes position requests and position responses (it will all be handled in background).

The positions of the friends that you are interested in are displayed on Google Maps.

To center the map around the positions of your friends, tap the "redraw button".

To start a query of your friends positions, tap the "friends button".

Note that each notification are deleted when processing is completed.

Tip: If you want to change your phone number just make a "long press" on the "friends button".
