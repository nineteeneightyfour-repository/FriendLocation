# FriendLocation
The FriendLocation app is a simple app with which you can trace the locations of your friends. The app uses a simple protocol (FRIEND_LOCATION_REQUESTS and FRIEND_LOCATION_RESPONSES), using SMS as the transport mechanism.

The locations of the friends that you are interested in are displayed on Google Maps. To center the map around the locations of your friends, tap the "redraw button".

To start a query of your friends locations, tap the "friends button".
